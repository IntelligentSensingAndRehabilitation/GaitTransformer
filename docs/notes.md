The file `gait_decoder_testing.py` has code used when testing this system and demonstrates features. It is for references only, as its usage is dependent on a lot of internal infrastructure tied to training the model and the datasets, all of which is managed with DataJoint schemas.

However, it demonstrates all the functionality of the model including detecting walking bouts, extracting steps, and creating overlays.
